    "The main purpose of the Random Automatic Keyword Extraction Algorithm is to extract meaningful keywords from the given text file. It can be implemented without the need of a corpus. The implementation of RAKE is also considered relatively easier than most of the other algorithms. Some of the drawbacks include not being able to extract meaningful words, that may not be accurate enough. It extracts key phrases from texts/individual documents.RAKE has better performance on long key phrase extraction compared to text mining algorithms."

      "ABSTRACTGiven the emergence of data science and machine learning throughout all aspects of society, but particularly in the scientiﬁc domain, there isincreased importance placed on obtaining data. Data in materials science are particularly heterogeneous, based on the signiﬁcant range inmaterials classes that are explored and the variety of materials properties that are of interest. This leads to data that range many orders ofmagnitude, and these data may manifest as numerical text or image-based information, which requires quantitative interpretation. Theability to automatically consume and codify the scientiﬁc literature across domains—enabled by techniques adapted from the ﬁeld of naturallanguage processing—therefore has immense potential to unlock and generate the rich datasets necessary for data science and machinelearning. This review focuses on the progress and practices of natural language processing and text mining of materials science literature andhighlights opportunities for extracting additional information beyond text contained in ﬁgures and tables in articles. We discuss and provideexamples for several reasons for the pursuit of natural language processing for materials, including data compilation, hypothesis develop-ment, and understanding the trends within and across ﬁelds. Current and emerging natural language processing methods along with theirapplications to materials science are detailed. We, then, discuss natural language processing and data challenges within the materials sciencedomain where future directions may prove valuable.Published under license by AIP Publishing.https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0021106TABLE OF CONTENTSI.

INTRODUCTIONData have always been a fundamental ingredient for realizing,accelerating, and optimizing any scientiﬁc pursuit. The increasingubiquity of data science methods, based on improved computingpower and algorithm development, has driven signiﬁcant opportunityand interest in immense, structured datasets. When such data areassembled in a form readily consumed and mined using data sciencetools, coupled with domain expertise, there is tremendous potential toaccelerate discovery,\n",
      "1build upon previous ﬁndings, rapidly enter anew ﬁeld, connect individual research efforts, and link acrossdisciplines.The physics community has long understood the value ofcurating data in a way that can be comprehended by computer logic.This is particularly true in the domains of high-energy physics, astron-omy, and astrophysics, where data emanate from very rare and spe-cialized research machines. For example, the Large Hadron Collider atCERN, in Switzerland, generates a wide range of data from particlecollisions, certain types of which can be measured using unique detec-tors, and enables collaborations among 3000 scientists and engineersfor each collaboration. Other examples include the gravitational-waveobservatories (LIGO\n",
      "2and Virgo3collaborations are currently>1000and>500 members, respectively) and widely shared astronomicalmappings from satellites and telescopes. These sources of data tend tobe managed by large international research facilities since multi-national efforts are needed to fund and build them. Scientists workwithin large, coordinated, research consortia to produce, process, andanalyze the data.4,5Raw data are contained within each facility but areaccessible, albeit sometimes in normalized form, and their particulardata characteristics tend to limit the variety of data types.However, one aspect of the physical sciences still wanting for moreand better organized data to leverage emerging data science tools is inthe domain of materials science. Successful examples of application ofmaterials informatics to the discovery of new materials can be found inalloy development,\n",

      "9,10However, these cases are still quite limited and suffer mostfrom lack of data. While there are a growing number of open databasesthat contain materials property information,\n",
      "11–15most of these databasesare created from computationally calculated properties. As an example,the materials project includes computational information for over130 000 inorganic compounds, and the analogous experimental data-bases only contain 9000 materials.\n",
      "15Experimentally based, large, andstructured materials property databases are still lacking.Unlike other ﬁelds, materials science lacks sufﬁcient incentive tomake it practical to centralize its data, not only because the data are sodiverse but also because data arise from so many independent scien-tists and laboratory sources.\n",

Data in the ﬁeld of materials science are particularly heterogeneous due to the wide variety of materialclasses studied by scientists.

      "materials science are particularly heterogeneous, based on the signiﬁ-cant range in materials classes that are explored and the variety ofmaterials properties that are of interest. This leads to data that rangemany orders of magnitude, and these data may manifest as numericaltext or image-based information, which requires quantitative interpre-tation. The many length scales of materials science add to this diver-sity, with data being measured from the atomic structure to massivecomponents that are integrated at a system level, such as airplanewings or turbine blades. In addition, only a small sub-set of specializedmaterials-physics research needs to be carried out at centralized facili-ties, such as government-run synchrotrons, neutron and muon sour-ces, nanocenters, high-magnetic ﬁeld laboratories, laser laboratories,or high-performance supercomputing facilities.\n",
      "17–21Some of thesefacilities archive the raw or normalized (“reduced”) data, and someoffer their scientiﬁc users the option to tag their experimental datawith a document object identiﬁer (DOI) to make them traceable.\n",
      "22Ifeven once such data become openly available, the metadata generatedby the experiment may be missing.\n",
      "23Metadata are vital for processingthe data to the point where one can interpret their scientiﬁc meaning.Fortunately, there is a prospective approach to address at leastsome aspects of this data-access quandary in materials science.Scientists will cede control of their processed data if they publish theirresults, and publications continue to be the primary means of commu-nicating within the materials domain. These data will be spread acrossvarious journal articles, patents, or company reports, owing to the vari-ety of ways that scientists can publish their ﬁndings. The data will alsopresent in an unstructured form, given the highly diverse way in whichscientists write an article and select the most salient results for show-casing their scientiﬁc points (i.e., as text or in ﬁgures, tables, and sche-matics). For example, scientists may report the composition of a metalalloy in one table, the processing conditions for that alloy in the bodytext of the methods, and then the ﬁnal properties in ﬁgures within theresults. Despite the distributed nature of these processed data, harvest-ing them from documents presents a way to retrieve materials-physicsdata en masse. The manual task of mining information from docu-ments by editors is not practical, given the amount of data that areneeded to succeed in the ﬁeld of materials informatics. A means toautomatically extract materials-physics data from scientiﬁc documentsis, therefore, required. This challenge presents a prime opportunity forinformation extraction and natural language processing (NLP),whereby “materials-aware” text-mining models can be used to collateprocessed data that lie within the literature to afford auto-generatedmaterials databases that can be used in materials informatics.Capturing unstructured information from the vast and ever-growing number of scientiﬁc publications has substantial promise tomeet this need and enable creation of experimental-based databasescurrently lacking. This reliance on publications in scientiﬁc communi-cation is exempliﬁed by the proliferation of new journals and increasedfrequency of publication.\n",
      "24–26Developing methods to mine the litera-ture for data may also prevent information loss. Without structuringinformation, scientists cannot make the necessary connections amongﬁndings; they may instead be drawn by what the authors of a scientiﬁcdocument have chosen to be highlighted in a journal or individualpublicity efforts. Scientiﬁc progress relies on hypothesis development,which requires leveraging increased knowledge toward greater under-standing, typically based on synthesizing existing information.Scientists are not trained to formalize their ﬁndings in a structuredway. The rapid growth of scientiﬁc knowledge has the potential to pro-vide opportunities to transfer solutions from one domain to addressproblems in another. However, the underlying relationships largelyremain embedded, and groups from disparate domains remain withintheir own specialties.24The signiﬁcant quantity of existing and newpublished literature. Limits what one individual can draw relationshipsbetween varied concepts, topics, and domains. There is a distinct valueto be drawn beyond what is known and what is known as individualsfrom the collective to broad multidisciplinary knowledge within andacross a given domain. This sharing and integration of informationacross communities is a tall order to accomplish comprehensively, butthe ability to automatically extract information from the literature canprovide a tool to facilitate this engagement.A. The scope of this reviewIn this review, we look at the fully and semi-automated means ofassembling and structuring scientiﬁc data through NLP and textmining.

Next, we focus on the tasks and methods involved, describingthe challenges for the materials science domain including a summaryof commonly used tools. Then, we show in detail about particularexamples of NLP applications in materials science. Next, we discussdata mining beyond NLP and how this nonetheless tracks back to thecognate need for NLP. Finally, we provide some commentary on thefuture needs and directions for the use of NLP as a tool for the materi-als community.II. THE WAYS THAT NLP CAN BENEFIT DATA-DRIVENMATERIALS SCIENCELeveraging NLP tools in materials science remains in its infancy.The methods used, and the level of accuracy required, vary dependingon the inquiring goal. Before diving into the details of how NLP is per-formed, we brieﬂy mention some of the key beneﬁts that NLP afford fordata science. These include generating datasets for mining and visualiza-tion across multiple research efforts, as well as contributing to machinelearning (ML) predictions and identifying research trends. Examples ofthe application of NLP in materials science will be provided in Sec.IV.The use of NLP on scientiﬁc text can generate libraries of infor-mation to explore, which enables data visualization, mining, and ana-lytics. The primary goals of text extraction can be used to populatedatabases with quantitative information or make text informationsummative and interactive in a way that can reveal patterns, gaps, ortrends. Advances in data analytics and visualization tools, described ingreater detail in Sec.V, have also accelerated the process of informa-tion consumption to decision-making.

Text extractioncan provide data that drive search-engine development in the scientiﬁcdomain and a beginning of active learning systems tied to automatedmaterials discovery and synthesis platforms.\n",
      "35–37\n",
      "Beyond data extraction and visualization, researchers may alsoleverage NLP to derive fundamental insight across these data; forexample, NLP may be used to ﬁnd relationships between compoundsby mapping materials mentioned in the text to corresponding chemi-cal structures. This identiﬁcation of relationships and trends is fre-quently done by using various ML techniques on the extracted data.Scientists can search for similar chemical structures or substructures,meaning that text information can be combined with knowledge fromestablished computational-property databases. For example, this com-bination of extracted and existing data might allow for exploring andscreening the relevance of compounds to a new application as a func-tion of published properties.\n",
      "38The ML models used vary in complex-ity, but the key opportunities for the scientiﬁc-language assemblyinclude literature-based knowledge discovery, suggesting novel scien-tiﬁc hypotheses, or predicting the outcomes of reactions.NLP activities across scientiﬁc text can also identify futureresearch trends by predicting emerging associations (co-occurrences)between selected keywords found in the scientiﬁc literature. This typeof analysis has been done previously for biochemistry,\n",

      "24TheNLP community presents a nuanced differentiation between“information extraction” and “knowledge-based creation” (traditionaland emergent approaches, respectively). Information extraction struc-tures extracted text according to entity recognition and entity relation-ships, which, then, feed into downstream search and query-basedactivities. Knowledge-based creation can provide an end unto itself inthe form of ontology development where facts and relationships witha discipline are extracted in a form that could be used to annotatearea-speciﬁc databases or to transfer knowledge between ﬁelds. Earlyefforts in materials science have focused primarily on informationextraction. Given the need for expanded datasets in materials science(beyond what is currently available), this is a logical emphasis. As thecommunity reﬁnes key tools toward NLP for materials, a broader setof pursuits can be realized.III. PERFORMING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSINGBefore delving into the speciﬁc details of methodology, we pro-vide a few key themes related to NLP, which convey the perspectivetaken in the materials science community. First, there are manualand semi-automated methods of literature-data extraction, whichyield insights into “small” datasets (i.e., tens to hundreds of relevantarticles), but the focus moving forward (and within this review) mustbe on the ability to apply methods to create large datasets (i.e., tens ofthousands of relevant articles). Generic NLP tools (such as CoreNLP)exist that do not perform well in the materials science domain with-out modiﬁcation, as the vernacular, sentence construction, terminol-ogy, and chemical semantics are specialized. Therefore, we need todevelop and apply materials-speciﬁc text mining tools to meet theneeds of this community. To reach any sort of economy of scaleacross such an interdisciplinary ﬁeld, approaches that transfer effec-tively within the materials science domain are needed, which requiresa balance between accuracy and generalizability. Each applicationspace will have local norms from which rules can be crafted for highlyaccurate information retrieval in that one domain; however, theserules often breakdown when applied to a different area of inquiry.Challenges with developing generalizable tools are also inﬂuenced bythe type of document and section within the document. Finally, thereis a tension in balancing model development toward the semantic orlinguistic structure of the document, while still incorporating criticaldomain knowledge in how individuals within the ﬁeld communicate.Natural language carries a high degree of ambiguity, and implicitknowledge plays a signiﬁcant role in how a ﬁeld communicates.However, if too much of this implicit knowledge is integrated withinmodels, leveraging the linguistic structure of the text becomes moredifﬁcult.Most natural language extraction pipelines follow a similar over-all approach, shown inFig. 2, which consists of (1) acquiring a relevantcorpus of text, (2) processing that text into individual terms, which is\n",

      "FIG. 2.Schematic of NLP including examples of tools and models at each step. It is visible that most natural language extraction follows similar approaches:(1) acquiring rele-vant text resources, (2) processing the text into individual terms (also known as tokenization), (3) document segmentation and paragraph classiﬁcation, (4) recognizing tokensas classes of information, (5) entity relation extraction, and (6) named entity linking.\n",

      "called tokenization, (3) segmenting documents and classifying para-graphs, (4) recognizing tokens as speciﬁc classes of information, gener-ally referred to as named entity recognition (NER), (5) entity relationextraction, and (6) named entity linking. Depending on the questionbeing pursued by researchers, pipelines may vary in their methods andapproach, including the order in which the above-described steps areperformed, the types of information models are provided, and devia-tions in the models themselves. Using broad strokes, we can describethe continuum of approaches as direct word mapping, deﬁning heuris-tics, and then to ML-based methods. ML approaches, in and of them-selves, can vary within the continuum of unsupervised to supervised,the latter requiring labeled data often in signiﬁcant volumes. This sec-tion describes details on each of these steps with materials-relevantmethod development presented with each step.A. Content acquisitionThe ﬁrst step is to develop and acquire a relevant corpus of sub-ject articles of interest from which information will be retrieved. Thecontent varies by the degree of accessibility, the corpus of subjectarticles of interest, and the kinds of documents (patents vs journalarticles, for example). This content can only be digested within thesubsequent models if rendered in plain text-accessible format,although there is variety in that format.\n",
      "45The older digitized contentis available primarily in portable document format (PDF) (introducedin 1993); however, even the older content may be preserved as images,presenting an insurmountable challenge in extracting information atscale. Converting PDF to plain text relies on spatial identiﬁcation ofblocks of text in a layout-aware manner, which is still an area ofresearch.\n",
      "46Errors may arise in terms of misplaced blocks of text andfont-conversion challenges. Most journals and publishers after themid-1990s also provide content as hypertext markup language(HTML) or extensible markup language (XML). HTML or XML oftenhas more consistency in their conversion to plain text format, but thisformat is not ubiquitous across publishers. Given the challenges asso-ciated with PDF conversion, nearly all reports of text mining of mate-rials science texts have been on articles available in markuplanguage.\n",
      "47,48\n",
      "Acquiring information from patents provides another way toobtain content, given patent accessibility and centralized hostingby country-speciﬁc patent ofﬁces. However, patent authors oftenseek to protect their knowledge from being fully disclosed, and so,these texts may have even more implicit information than journalarticles. Patents relevant to materials science have a closely deﬁnedstructure and style of presentation;\n",
      "49in particular, the examplesection mirrors the synthesis section, so they can be interpretedwith a high degree of accuracy. Patents will not be a focus of themethodology discussion going forward in this text, but they havebeen used in biology and chemistry applications with somefrequency.\n",
      "50\n",
      "The downloaded content consists of article text and meta-data (journal name, title, abstract, and author names). The meta-data provide value in databasing the content, as well as beinghigh-level information that can inform entity recognition asdescribed below; it is typically more structured than the docu-ment content.B. Text preprocessing and tokenizationOnce the content has been obtained, three main activities are usedto manipulate the information contained within the text: entity extrac-tion, entity relation, and entity linking. This overall ﬂow begins with aseries of steps that preprocess the text of the article to enable identiﬁca-tion of the desired information. Preprocessing will vary according to theorder of events and the tools used for each stage. A low-level, but critical,step is character encoding, establishing the way that the characters arerepresented.Tokenization(a form of preprocessing) segments text intothe relevant sentences, phrases, words, or word pieces, to be processedindividually or as a sequence. Punctuation marks are the obviousapproach to identify sentences, but the language of the scientiﬁc domainis often complicated by terms that are composed of multiple words, sym-bols, and other types of structural entities, which, therefore, requiresspecialized tokenization pipelines. Some examples of this challenge withchemical and material notation include the uses of commas:(Y,In)BaCo3ZnO7;periods:(La 0.8Sr0.2)0.97MnO3or CuSO4/C15H2O;hyphens: (1/C0x)Pb(Zr\n",

Matching regular expressions to identify sectionheaders provides an easy guide, and this can be done simply usingstring matching within a set of text or regular expression (regex)coding, although the variation in the application of headers by pub-lishers can present a challenge even in this straightforward activity.Huo and colleagues have recently applied probabilistic methods, suchas latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), across several million articles touse unsupervised approaches to identify experimental steps implied insentences.\n",
      "56LDA provided a probabilistic topic distribution for eachsentence. These authors, then, applied random decision forests, usingthe topic n-gram as the feature, to classify different types of synthesisprocedures; this required annotation of only a few hundred para-graphs. Another feature of this work is that the authors were able toconstruct a Markov chain representation of the material synthesis ﬂowchart.As an alternative to the unsupervised approaches discussed,Hiszpanskiet al.used a supervised ML approach to evaluate everysentence within an article and extract solution-based synthesis proto-cols.\n",
      "57Speciﬁcally, by iterative rounds of training with human-annotated sentences, they trained a logistic regression classiﬁer thatyields the likelihood of a given sentence describing solution-based syn-thesis protocols based on the words present within the sentence. Asmay be expected from scientiﬁc writing conventions, past tense verbs,unit terms (e.g., ml and min), and chemicals are weighed heavily asbeing indicative of a synthesis description. Surprisingly, functionwords such as “the,” “of,” “then,” and “and,” which are normally ﬁl-tered out from text as “stop words” in nonscientiﬁc applications, occurmore commonly in synthesis protocols and are important in distin-guishing sentences that concern synthesis or otherwise. This observa-tion points out again how traditional NLP approaches may need to bemodiﬁed when these tools are translated in their application from gen-eral texts to the scientiﬁc literature.D. Named entity recognition (NER)Each of the preprocessing steps described above enable the heartof the text-extraction activity, NER, which identiﬁes the objects ofsemantic value by recognizing and classifying concepts mentioned inthe text. Entities are useful in and of themselves for researchers to mapto properties, to ﬁnd similar compounds, or to incorporate in annota-tion labeling. Historically, immense effort has gone into NER for themedical domain, extracting symptoms, diagnoses, and medicationsfrom text.\n",
      "27The chemistry domain has expended signiﬁcant effort inNER, but even state-of-the-art NER systems do not typically performwell when applied to different domains, and effort is required to createquality data for trainable statistical NER systems.\n",
      "58\n",
      "NER is an area where the materials community is clearly in itsinfancy. There is a need for training data to develop entity-recognitionmodels. Where knowledge bases exist already for a ﬁeld, training maybe done using distant supervision models that map known entities andrelations onto unstructured text. In the computer-science community,this activity is supported by “all community” developed learning tasksthat are orchestrated through conferences in the ﬁeld; these tend totackle signiﬁcant challenges along a roadmap, thereby making con-certed progress as a domain.\n",
      "59There is no equivalent yet in the materi-als space.The general methods for NER range from dictionary look-ups,rule-based, and machine-learned approaches. Typical pipelines usedin the materials science domain include hybrids of all three of theseapproaches. Hybrid systems provide a balance of precision with com-putational efﬁciency, where only those cases that cannot be handledby dictionaries or rules pass to ML approaches to make efﬁcient use ofannotated data. Dictionary look-ups include material composition,chemical element names, properties, as well as processes and experi-mental parameters.Hand-crafted rule/knowledge-based methods are a collection ofrules or speciﬁcations deﬁning how to handle relative ordering andmatching among those rules. Rules may be developed through corpus-based systems that require examining several cases to obtain thepatterns or via domain knowledge understanding of nomenclature con-vention. To overcome the time intensive nature of rule development,strategies have been developed to learn rules through small collectionsof seed examples that begin from very high precision rules and learn togeneralize orvice versa. Examples of these approaches includeLeadMine,60which uses naming convention rules, ChemicalTagger,61\n",
      "which parses experimental synthesis sections of chemistry texts, andportions of ChemDataExtractor, which uses nested rules. For example,when researchers extended ChemDataExtractor for use in magneticmaterials, additions were made for domain-speciﬁc parsing rulesincluding off-stoichiometry and relevant terms associated with thedomain of interest (in this case magnetic materials such as ferroelectricsand ferrites).\n",
      "51\n",
      "Finally, at the other end of the continuum of NER, approachesare ML-based statistical models, which use a feature-based representa-tion of observed data to recognize speciﬁc entity names. These modelstypically depend on sets of annotated documents, which rely on anno-tated corpora and the development of metrics for inter-annotatoragreement where multiple annotators are involved. Given that a sen-tence is represented as a sequence of words, it is insufﬁcient to con-sider only the current word class; therefore, sequential (and typicallybidirectional) models are necessary to consider the proceeding, cur-rent, and following word. While rule-based approaches are tedious todevelop and not easily generalized, supervised ML models, in contrast,require substantial expert-annotated data for training along withdetailed annotation guidelines. ML models invite careful considerationof the types of classes that are identiﬁed and the order in which labelsare classiﬁed. Initial NER work speciﬁc to the materials domain wasperformed by Kimet al.\n",

These modelsmay be intrinsic, wherein they identify semantic relations, or extrinsic.Character-based word representation models help with “what does theword look like”; these use the individual character of a token to gener-ate the token vector representation and include morphemes (sufﬁxesand preﬁxes) and morphological inﬂections (number and tense).

      "68,69the authors haveundertaken speciﬁc NER efforts related to that domain, termedpolyNER. A synthetic polymer is rarely a single entity and is describedinstead by distributions of molecular weight, often in conjunction withnonstandard naming conventions or trade names.\n",
      "68Thus, polyNERfocuses on a necessary pretreatment for polymer entity recognition,highlighting the challenges of generalizing NER tools across disparatedomains within materials science. As another example, in work pur-sued by Kononovaet al.on solid-state synthesis of inorganic materials,material entries were processed with a material parser that convertedstrings for a material into a chemical formula, which in turn was splitinto elements and stoichiometric balances. Then, the authors obtainedbalanced reactions from precursors and target materials by solving asystem of linear equations; this included a set of open compounds thatcan be released or absorbed, which were inferred based on the compo-sition of precursor and target materials.\n",

      "Often, these approaches require hybrid system development,where the computer automates one aspect of the activity and humanintervention enables precise execution.

Huang and Ling recently proposed multi-wordidentifying and representing methods. This involves recognizing themulti-word phrases in the chemical literature through unsupervisedmethods and then representing the phrases in the vocabulary.73\n",
      "Typically, word embedding is performed after tokenization withphrase representation obtained based on a post-vector addition. Inthis method, a new step is incorporated to identify multi-word phrasesand add the detected terms to the vocabulary. In this case, wordembedding is performed afterwards at the phrase level. Huang andLing’s computationally intense approach starts from tokenized andtrimmed single words and sentence context. Then, they use scoringfunctions to identify bigrams, repeating this process up to n-grams,and then move to phrase-level word embedding.\n",
      "74,75\n",
      "E. Entity relation extraction and linkingEntity relation extraction is the activity that identiﬁes relationsbetween entities mentioned in a given document. It is primarily donein post-processing steps after NER. Entities extracted can also belinked to their properties or co-occurrence with other entities, whichallows new knowledge between them to be identiﬁed. Efforts have pri-marily focused on the co-occurrence of entities within a few sentencesof each other, although there is a need to extend this to a fulldocument.Within materials science, most entity-relation extraction occursthrough dependency parsing. More direct supervised ML-basedapproaches would require the development of larger annotated cor-pora and quantifying similarity by computing representation similar-ity. One approache used in materials examples concerns Snowballmethods, which include seed examples of known positive relation-ships. Based on locating sentences with these seed examples, typicalpatterns are learned using clustering of textual similarity.\n",
      "61By compar-ing unseen sentences to learned patterns, new relationships can beidentiﬁed based on a threshold minimum level of similarity. Thesemethods have been extended recently within ChemDataExtractor toolsusing a modiﬁed Snowball algorithm.\n",
      "51The original Snowball algo-rithm uses several thousand seed examples.\n",
      "76For the modiﬁedSnowball algorithm, the quaternary relationships included the prop-erty speciﬁer, chemical entity mention, property value, and thenunit.\n",
      "51Named entity linking, then, connects information extractedfrom text with data stored in curated databases where the challengesare to delineate entities that are different from those that are synonymsand should be linked to one unique identiﬁer.There are several issues to consider after initially applying NLPtechniques to scientiﬁc text. First, whether or not the data are extractedaccurately. Second, are the data reported correctly. Third, are databeing reported with sufﬁcient details to warrant these efforts. As theprocess of text mining proceeds down the pipeline shown inFig. 2,theaccuracy of the extracted data decays rapidly, and noise accumulates.Hence, the choice between having higher precision within a set ofextracted data vs having a larger dataset size becomes pivotal becausethis choice will signiﬁcantly affect the results of the data mining. Kimet al.showed that even when using millions of raw papers as a startingposition, numbers may drop to just hundreds of thousands of papersdepending on the speciﬁc topic.\n",
      "47Data loss arises not only due toimperfections of the extraction methods but also, oftentimes, due tothe misrepresentation of the original information.

The pursuit of ground truth forsupervised ML within NLP is costly and time-consuming since it isbased on the limited annotated documents thus far as discussedabove. Whether or not accuracy that is sufﬁcient for the spread ofgoals of NLP and text mining in materials science can be achievedis still an open question.F. Conceptual networkSeparate from the NLP pipeline described above, the use of text-based approaches to generally learn a ﬁeld has been an area of interestlinked to the concept of ontologies, as described above. A high-levelworkﬂow for ontology generation is as follows: ﬁrst, generate conceptlists through expert input and comparisons between a curated refer-ence list and a random set of scientiﬁc documents. Then, use methods,such as bag-of-words, to populate the ontology. Recent work used ahierarchical LDA, which learned an overall structure from the dataand generated a tree of classes that could be used for searching terms,annotation, and standardization of metadata.\n",
      "77There are a few inter-esting ways to generate these concept lists. The work by Krenn andZelinger analyzed trends in quantum physics by generating a conceptlist through human-expert input that is expanded by Rapid AutomaticKeyword Extraction to a term list; this is, then, fed into a comprehen-sive corpus to establish links between each of the terms. To projectfuture directions of research, they performed a link-prediction task toask which new link will be formed between unconnected vertices giventhe current network. This was done using an artiﬁcial neural networkwith four fully connected layers, which ranked unconnected pairs ofconcepts and further extended this approach to identify pairs withexceptional network properties.\n",

Most have beenfocused on capabilities to extract entities from body text, but manyhave expanded efforts to extract tables as well. Several also have a focuson extracting biology-relevant information, which stems from the ear-lier leading NLP efforts in life sciences. The groups that developedthese tools have taken varied approaches, tailored to their speciﬁcsub-ﬁeld of literature. The tools typically vary with the tokenizers andtechniques that they use to identify chemicals, which often involve acombination of dictionaries, hand-crafted rules/patterns, andPOS-tagging methods, as previously discussed.Researchers are likely to be interested in extracting categories ofinformation, which are speciﬁc to their research topic and beyond, forwhich there are readily available tools shown inTable I.Ifthecategoryof information that is desired has a formulaic representation, or it hasa limited number of possible ways of being expressed, then rather sim-ple pattern- or dictionary-based approaches can be created to extractthis new category of information.

      "88,89are largely driven by unsupervised methods and mayserve to resolve mentions of materials into canonical, physically mean-ingful entities.However, developing ML models requires many examples ofhuman-annotated text for training and testing a model, which can dic-tate a heavy investment of time. For those embarking on this route,easy-to-use tools for text annotation are needed. Many free and com-mercial tools exist and continue to be developed for text annotation; assuch, a comprehensive review unrealistic but some commonly usedtools include brat,\n",
      "90Prodigy,91WebAnno,92and Callisto.93Acom-mon question that often arises is how many annotated data areenough data to train a good model? The unsatisfying answer is thatone cannot concretely say until one tries. ML-model development isoften an iterative process involving model training and testing. If theperformance of a model does not meet expectations, then a commonmeans of trying to improve the model is to retrain it with additionaldata, i.e., more annotated text.The lack of publicly available materials-relevant corpora withhuman annotations is hindering progress in NLP research within mate-rials science. Having such publicly available datasets would reduce theneed for newcomers in the ﬁeld to engage in the costly annotation exer-cise previously described. Additionally, such datasets are essential forenabling comparisons of the performance of new entity-recognitionmodels. This comparison is necessary to help the entire ﬁeld of NLPfor materials science better understand our progress and shortcomings.The largest and most materials-relevant publicly available corpus ofannotations is the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER corpus, which was cre-ated from a community-wide effort in the 2000s to make a “gold stand-ard” for training and testing NLP tools for the life-science literature.\n",
      "58\n",
      "The corpus consists of 10 000 abstracts, taken from PubMed in 2013with 84 355 human-annotated chemical entity mentions, correspondingto 19 806 unique chemical names.Currently, no large-scale equivalent corpus derived from thematerials science literature exists, but smaller and more materials-focused annotated corpora are beginning to be reported, which haveannotations beyond only chemicals, as well. For example, Mysoreet al.released 230 materials-synthesis procedures with annotations ofmaterials, operations, conditions, apparatuses, and units, amongstothers.\n",
      "94Likewise, Hiszpanskiet al.recently released “gold standard”annotations of chemicals and wet-synthesis protocols from 99 articlespertaining to materials synthesis that they then used to compare theperformance of various chemical entity recognition tools that are iden-tiﬁed inTable I.\n",
      "57Other recent examples include data related to solid-state electrolytes and fuel cells.\n",
      "95,96Though somewhat further aﬁeldfrom materials, Kulkarniet al.created an annotated corpus of 622wet-lab protocols from experimental biology that has labeled actions,conditions, reagents, amounts, and concentrations, amongst others.\n",
      "97\n",
      "There have also been attempts to make the annotation process moreefﬁcient through improved interfaces that could potentially enablecrowd-sourced annotations,\n",
      "98although domain expertise has provencritical. There is a paucity of relevant annotated datasets for the ﬁeld ofmaterials science. Each of these examples required signiﬁcant domainexpertise and time to craft. Continued efforts by the materials commu-nity to share annotated corpora will only help further accelerate pro-gress in this ﬁeld.To add details around datasets/corpora size, within NLP research,the number of documents is oftentimes provided as an implied proxyfor data size, as we have done throughout. The number of documentsprovides a relevant metric for tasks associated with word embeddingmodels, for example (where the corpora associated with materials sci-ence is small relative to the large number of texts in the scientiﬁcdomain more broadly). However, of relevance beyond the number ofdocuments is the number of tokens of a particular class present inthose documents. Ideally, for machine learning, training data are inde-pendent and identically distributed, but we know that this is not thecase when dealing with tokens within documents for NLP. Rare is it toﬁnd a training corpus that has speciﬁc entities in nearly equal amountsacross the documents. Some documents are of greater relevance to atopicandaremorelikelytohavemoretokens,andwithinthescientiﬁcliterature, it is expected that published works will inﬂuence others’works. Thus, training data for NLP applications are far from beingindependent and identically distributed. While providing a precisenumber will vary by tasks, one can surmise an approximation of whata “large enough” dataset constitutes by surveying the material NLP lit-erature. In these works, after ﬁltering documents for relevancy, mosthave document corpora on the order of tens-of-thousands where eachdocument has dozens to low hundreds of entities and entity relationsfor a speciﬁc token class.Finally, a critical but often overlooked category of tools necessaryfor reaping the full beneﬁts of NLP efforts is data visualization tools.The NLP of the materials literature creates structured datasets fromunstructured text, but databases by themselves are of little use if onecannot see and explore the data interactively. While hard-coded plotsand graphs can be presented, such ﬁxed visualizations do not allowfurther exploration of the dataset beyond the presented perspective.The interactive aspect of data visualization is critical to broaden theutility of such databases and enable users to form hypotheses and testthem, thereby building their own understanding of trends. Interactivevisualization dashboards, which typically have multiple frames of dif-ferent data representations, are effective tools for this purpose. Custominteractive dashboards can be created using freely available open-source software packages such as Candela,99Bokeh,100and D3.101Theincreased ubiquity and interest in data science have also spurred manycommercial software packages for creating custom interactive visuali-zation of data, which are commonly marketed as business intelligenceand analytics tools.V.

The reasons for this pursuit include generating data for mining,visualization, contributing to ML predictions, and the identiﬁcation ofresearch trends. The ultimate goal of NLP in materials science wouldbe to evolve toward a new way of thinking about materials discovery,but this will only become possible as databases that suit a given appli-cation are developed.\n",

      "33The information densityof data extraction (number of data records obtained: number of paperssampled) is quite low in this case, relative to the above examples oftext extraction from documents. This is because the data sought onUV/vis absorption spectra nearly always take the form of corematerials-characterization data, which support rather than lead thefocus of a paper. Accordingly, the information is semi-hidden in apaper or is entirely latent, often being relegated to the supplementarymaterial of a paper. The data that do appear in the main article arehighly fragmented and are somewhat elusive to keyword search terms.Moreover, materials-metrology data are reported over a particularlywide range of journals, compared with synthesis or materials-centereddata. For example, there are journals that are dedicated to chemicalsynthesis, materials chemistry, or materials physics, such that it is fac-ile to choose the journals to mine, which are rich in the contentrequired to populate a database that suits a given application. In con-trast, UV/vis absorption spectral characteristics will be noted in apaper of any journal that reports a new chemical product, which isoptically absorbing, as well as being present in papers that focus onoptical properties. The information density of data extraction is thuslow, such that NLP tools must track many more papers for the desiredoutcome. This issue tracks a general trend that despite the highly per-vasive nature of core materials-characterization data, such as UV/visabsorption spectra, they can be quite inaccessible to NLP tools.Beyond, the datasets themselves are the capabilities to visualizethem and comment on trends within them. For example, Hiszpanskiet al.packaged the data that they extracted from 35 000 metallic nano-material synthesis articles into a distributable visualization tool thatallows users to explore how the chemicals used in protocols varydepending on the targeted nanomaterial morphology and composi-tion. For the case of the pulsed-laser deposition data, the extractionenabled visualization of growth windows, trends, and outliers (Fig. 3,¶); these serve as an initial pathway for analyzing the distribution ofgrowth conditions to act as feedback for ﬁrst-principles calculations tolink with thermodynamic stability windows.

For example, alkali and transition-metal cations are typicallyused in a reaction based on several types of precursors, includingbinary oxides, nitrides, sulﬁdes, or simple salts such as carbonates,phosphates, and nitrates. They also observed that the counterion insolid-state synthesis controls the temperature of precursor melting ordecomposition. This could indicate when the precursor becomes activeduring synthesis or direct the synthesis method.The next level of depth within the materials examples that haveleveraged NLP are those that perform some degree of ML on the datatoward the pursuit of fundamental insights. Within the work by Courtand Cole, case studies of perovskite-type oxides and pnictide super-conductors demonstrated that magnetic and superconducting phasediagrams could be reconstructed with good accuracy (Fig. 3,¶), andassociated phase-transition temperature predictions could be made,which were relatable to the underlying physical theory of magnetismand superconductivity. Speciﬁcally, the authors were able to predictN/C19eel temperatures in rare-earth manganites and orthochromites anddocument the unconventional superconductivity of ferropnictidesuperconductors, as well as predict Tcacross the lanthanides. Themodels used elemental and structural features as a basis. While thiscontribution was for known compounds, the overall approach pointsto the ability to extend this capability to discovery.\n",

      "Methods based on quantitative structure-property relationships(QSPRs) are also being adapted. Such approaches are long-standing onthe small scale, but multiple structure-property relationships are nowbeing drawn together to analyze volumes of data. For example, a hier-archical sequence of questions with the generic form “Which data obeythis QSPR?” can be set within an inverse pyramid construct of decisionmaking to successively whittle down a large dataset to a few lead candi-dates that hold all of the requested QSPR requirements that suit a givenmaterial application (Fig. 3,‚). The lead candidates that result fromthis materials screening process are, then, experimentally validated.

Ontologies provide and formalize semantics of each entityand their speciﬁc domain. Ontologies are organized in formalmachine-readable formats. This enables their integration in relationextraction models, and they may provide opportunities to learn ontol-ogies for how materials information should be presented and whatneeds to be included. A recent effort in biomaterials generated anontology to attempt to develop an accepted taxonomy for manufac-tured biomaterials; this captured the complexity of how scaffolds anddevices are described and named. Examples of some of the super-classes generated were manufactured objects, biomaterials, materialprocessing, effects on the biological system, and medical applications.The goals of this work were to provide an annotation resource to facili-tate “term” (or “entity” in the NLP domain) recognition, outline“accepted” or used language in the ﬁeld, and offer a common basis forunderstanding the range of distinct scaffolds with their associated fea-tures, beyond just the materials and document discovery.\n",

Particles are detected by a sequential process of image binariza-tion and thresholding, followed by a series of contour-detectionalgorithms. These algorithms use edge detection to identify all closedcontours (particles), excluding any that are occluded by image annota-tion (e.g., particles that lie beneath the scale bar) or are truncatedbecause they lie at the edge of an image, split apart particles that lieparticularly close to each other, and reﬁne contour detection usingellipse ﬁtting where required. Particle sizes are determined via opticalcharacter recognition (OCR), which helps to detect and read the textin the scale bar of each image; this scale bar information is normalizedwith respect to the number of pixels in each image, in order to calcu-late the particle size.

This semantic segmenta-tion method is, then, complemented by instance segmentation.

CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIESMany challenges still exist for information extraction and NLP inthe materials domain, which stem largely from the complexity andheterogeneity of the text. For NLP speciﬁc to materials, there are chal-lenges with transferability across materials domains given the highlevel of heterogeneity in the discipline, ranging across materials classes,application space, and even fundamental links between chemistry andphysics. Since the volume of data within each of these individualdomains may be relatively small, the accuracy of the models becomescritical so that data points are not lost as an extraction pipeline pro-gresses. Of course, text extracted from the materials science literatureis not and cannot be the only source of data leveraged by the informat-ics community. High-throughput experimental and computationaldata ported directly into informatics models still provide the most sig-niﬁcant, high quality source of inputs to ML models. Text extractedinformation provides a supplement to these sources. In general, thechallenges in use of NLP to “generate” and compile data are the agevariety of quality of texts and the bias within the published literaturebased on the absence of negative examples.Despite these challenges, there is potential (and need) to leveragethe vast archive of information in published scientiﬁc text, toward thegeneration of new knowledge. For this to be successful, we must con-tinue to push the boundary of what information can be extracted accu-rately and at scale, but we must also ensure that the extraction is donetoward increased synergy with downstream ML algorithm develop-ment. One example of this synergy would be improvements in extrac-tion, which are focused on transfer learning, whereby the languagerepresentations are pre-trained, in an unsupervised manner, on cor-pora and ﬁne-tuned on a variety of speciﬁc materials questions forwhich there are fewer data. This will allow each speciﬁc area ofresearch within materials science communities to work towardimproving accuracy, while sharing the collected data for others tobuild-off of and to continue to grow the database and the collectiveinformation. Advances in entity linking, where entities within a textare automatically linked to databases of information, would also pro-vide distinct synergistic opportunities to leverage fundamental physicalknowledge to downstream ML activities.One critical challenge in NLP is to draw linked informationacross a document, or the so-called non-local dependencies. To date,information extraction has focused on the use of sequential modelsthat rely primarily on local dependencies. However, as experimentsare described throughout a document, this is a signiﬁcant limitation toreaching at scale accurate, automated extraction from the scientiﬁctext, particularly since we aim to extract information across body text,ﬁgures, images, and even the supplementary material. To date, this hasmostly been done through post-processing activities by constrainingthe output space during inference, but automatically learning interac-tions between local and non-local dependencies would provide a sig-niﬁcant opportunity to improve learning. One recent effort used agraph-based framework to represent a broad, cross-document set ofword or sentence-level dependencies and deﬁne a data structure with-out access to any major processing or external resources.143Thisbecomes NER at the discourse level (DiscNER), in contrast tosentence-level NER, where sentences are processed independently.This means that long-range dependencies have a crucial role in thetagging process and that they can be added as a soft constraint toimprove information extraction. Given the challenge of labeling long-distance linkages within documents, unsupervised learning may proveuseful toward advancing this branch of research. In language transla-tion\n",

      "11,106,146One of these exceptions106involved concertingNLP-based database auto-generation with high-throughput electronic-structure calculations on the materials that populated this database.This produced pairwise experimental and computational data onchemicals in the database. This synergy stands to be very powerful fora number of reasons. First, the comparison between pairwise experi-mental and computational data of a given material provides implicitquality control of a database; achieving the quality control of NLP-based auto-generated databases is a matter of concern that has beenraised by various agencies.\n",

In this sense, computa-tional data have a distinct advantage over experimental data since thelatter are naturally limited to the contents of the documents fromwhich they were extracted by NLP. Third, such pairwise data can miti-gate the common problem that important experimental data are oftennot available to suit a particular need in material physics in whichcase, computation provides a means to combat issues of missing data,\n",

      "153The increasing government regulations toward open-access data will also help journals capture data. These sorts of initia-tives will help make data sources themselves more easily processedand analyzed, perhaps in raw data form. This aim is all but a pipedream on a wide scale, at present, and even if such automation in dataprocessing becomes normal in materials physics, NLP will still be inbusiness for the long term. This is not only because of the hugeamount of legacy data that already exist worldwide but also because itwill likely never be practical to process raw data from highly specialistexperiments automatically since the data analysis will be similarly spe-cialized. NLP, therefore, has a bright future to continue to supportautomatic extraction from the literature.VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKSNLP and information extraction are early in their application tomaterials science. It will continue to require sustained effort to builddomain-relevant extraction algorithms, scientiﬁc dependency parsers,annotation sets, and structures for disseminating extracted informa-tion. There are domain-speciﬁc needs regarding accuracy and ambigu-ity and tradeoffs to be weighed between the accuracy and degree ofgeneralizability. However, we have shown that there is tremendouspotential if we can unlock the troves of information within the primaryway that we choose to communicate in the scientiﬁc community,through published, unstructured documents.Throughout discussions of the rise of data in materials science,there is a dialog regarding encouraging researchers to deposit theirown data. We must make sure that data continue to be disseminatedin a way that provides direct compute operability;\n",
      "154infrastructuredevelopment within materials science needs to be in lockstep to allowthat to happen. Given the potential for data science tools in accelerat-ing the materials development process, data in general, and particu-larly freely available open data, need to undergo an inversion ofpriorities. Thus far, materials scientists have only considered humansfamiliar with their subject material as the audience for their publishedworks. However, with application of NLP to materials science increas-ing, an entirely new audience should also be considered by authors:software tools. Unfortunately, the writing styles and data presentationformats that are often most interesting to the former can prove quitechallenging to the latter. If we shift the pendulum toward data struc-tures that enable compute capabilities, we will not only be able to bet-ter leverage the data revolution as materials scientists, we will increasethe reproducibility and comprehension of our output.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSE.A.O., O.K., and G.C. would like to acknowledge fundingfrom the National Science Foundation under Award Nos. 1922311,1922372, and 1922090 and DMREF and support from the Ofﬁce ofNaval Research (ONR) under Contract Nos.
