Dataset: penguins_size.csv

This is a project that was implemented as a part of my Machine Learning and Patterns Recognition course in my university. Exploratory data analysis was performed on the Penguin dataset (penguins_size.csv). The two split ratios of training, validation and test: 80-10-10 and 60-20-20 were used for analyzing the dataset. Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms were used to implement GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters.
