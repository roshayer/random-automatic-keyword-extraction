# NLP-RAKE

Patent Keyword Extraction Algorithm (PKEA) and Random Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithms were used to analyze scientific papers to extract patent related keywords. Unsupervised machine learning techniques were used extensively throughout the project to retrieve keywords. Evaluation metrics like IG and SVM were used to validate the accuracy of the PKEA algorithm against RAKE in terms of patent keywords retrieval.
